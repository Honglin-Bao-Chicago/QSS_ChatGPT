# QSS_ChatGPT

This is the GitHub repository for the paper "Where there's a will there's a way: ChatGPT is used more for science in countries where it is prohibited", forthcoming in Quantitative Science Studies. Preprint: https://arxiv.org/abs/2406.11583

We have data named like: data_arxiv_track_country_{all_authors; last_author; first_author}, which means that we track the publishing activity according to three types of authors and these authors' countries (details see Appendix 2 in the paper).
